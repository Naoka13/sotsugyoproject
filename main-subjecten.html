                        <p><span></span>The origin of Shinto goes back to ancient Japan. Based on rice farming that was introduced from the end of the Jomon period to the Yayoi period, it is said that the "nature worship" that gods dwell in the natural world such as the sea, mountains, and trees arose in the Japanese archipelago. Before long, people began to believe that gods resided not only in the natural world but also in business, learning, homes, rice, and everything else, and the gods in Shinto came to be called 'eight million gods.' It has played an important role in all aspects of life for ancient people who lived in harmony with nature. In Shinto, the god of the sun, Amaterasu Omikami, is considered the supreme deity, and its descendant is said to be the emperor.

                        <p><span></span>Buddhism was founded by Gautama Siddhartha in India around the 4th to 6th century BC. It is said that it crossed over from India to China, and then came to Japan from China around the 6th century. In addition, Buddhism in Japan was popularized by Prince Shotoku, and he built many temples throughout Japan, including Horyuji and Shitennoji, and spread the thought of Buddhism.

                        <p><span></span>The Tendai sect is a sect of Buddhism founded by Tendai Daishi Chigi (Monks from the period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties in China to the Sui Dynasty) in Tiantai County, Zhejiang Province, China during the Sui dynasty. The Tendai sect preached the teaching of the Lotus Ichijo, which states that all people can become Buddhas. It is also called the mother mountain of Buddhism because the founders of each sect such as Honen (A Japanese monk from the late Heian period to the early Kamakura period.) and Shinran (Japanese Buddhists in the early to middle Kamakura period) learned the Tendai sect.

                        <p><span></span>Shingon Buddhism is a sect of Mahayana Buddhism founded by Kukai (Monks in the early Heian period) in the early 9th century (Heian period) and is one of Japanese Buddhism. It is based on the esoteric Buddhism that Kukai learned from Eka at Seiryu-ji Temple after traveling to Changan. He spread the teaching that anyone can become a Buddha immediately by acting in the same way as a Buddha called "Sokushin Jobutsu" and keeping a pure heart.

                        <p><span></span>Jodo sect is one of the Japanese Buddhism founded by Honen in 1175. The Jodo sect preached a doctrine called ``Kanmuryojukyosho,'' in which one simply chants the Nembutsu without doing any other practice. In addition, according to the Jodo sect, chanting Namu Amidabutsu purifies the mind and body, and after death, one can be reborn in the Pure Land and become a Buddha.

                        <p><span></span>Jodo Shinshu is one of the Pure Land sects and is also known as Kamakura Buddhism. It was opened by Shinran, a disciple of Honen, the founder of the Jodo sect. Pure Land Buddhism is a teaching of absolute other power that advocates the salvation of all people by Amida Buddha (In Buddhism of the Pure Land sect, Amida belief is preached that one can be reborn in the Pure Land through the shomyo nenbutsu called 'Namu Amida Butsu'.) and is characterized by the idea that one can attain Buddhahood immediately if one is born with faith. With over 12 million followers nationwide, Jodo Shinshu is the largest Buddhist force in Japan.

                        <p><span></span>The person who spread Buddhism is said to be Prince Shotoku (Imperial Family and Politicians of the Asuka Period). However, when Buddhism was first introduced, there was a conflict between the Soga clan (supporters) and the Mononobe clan (opposition) over whether to accept Buddhism. Therefore, Prince Shotoku cooperated with the Soga clan to overthrow the Mononobe clan and spread Buddhism. It is said that he was aiming for a centralized state centered on the emperor by using Buddhist thought.

In Shinto, the descendants of Amaterasu Omikami are regarded as emperors, which means that if the emperor believes in Buddhism, the ancient Japanese gods will come under Buddhism. Therefore, to make Shinto and Buddhism compatible, ``Shinbutsu Shugo'' was created, which equates Japanese gods with Buddhism.

Amaterasu Oomikami, the sun god who illuminates the world, and Susanoo no Mikoto, the younger brother of the god of the sea. Susanoo has a bad temper and always causes trouble for those around him. Because Amaterasu hid in the cave, the world became dark and many disasters occurred. It is said that the origin of the festival is that the eight million gods began to make a fuss in front of the rock to get Amaterasu out of the rock.

In Japan, festivals have been held every four seasons since ancient times, and the meaning and purpose of the festivals differ depending on the season. Many of the summer festivals are said to have originated from driving away pest typhoons that interfere with good harvests. In addition, summer is the season when epidemics tend to spread, so there are summer festivals aimed at driving away epidemics.

It is a summer festival that boasts a large scale.

                            <br><span></span>According to one theory, it is said to have already existed in the middle of the 6th century, and it is thought that the belief in the god of agriculture and the ancestors combined to create the god who protects the house. It is said that the origin of New Year's Day is that the old Japanese people welcomed the god of the new year at the beginning of the year and entertained them to bring happiness and prosperity to their homes.
                            <br><span></span>There are also things related to the New Year such as osechi (It is the traditional meal only prepared for New Year). It is said that osechi ryori was prepared as a form of hospitality for the New Year's deity. It has been said that by offering food to the gods and eating them at the same time, you will receive the blessings of the gods. In addition, each osechi dish has auspiciousness and various meanings.

And one of the events that is said to be the origin of Hatsumode is "Toshikamori". Toshigomori means "the head of a village or family shuts himself up at a shrine or temple where the local deity is enshrined from the night of New Year's Eve to the morning of New Year's Day without sleeping." And the custom of praying for a good harvest and safety in the new year through the night has been handed down to this day.

A visit on New Year's Eve is called "New Year's Day", and a visit on New Year's Day is called "New Year's Day". On New Year's Day, it was customary to visit the shrines and temples that enshrine the tutelary deity of the area where you live, or the shrines and temples that are in the lucky direction of the year when viewed from your home. This was later called "Ehomiri". It originated in the Kansai region and is said to be related to Ehomaki sushi roll (It is thick sushi roll which is believed to bring good fortune if eaten while facing the year’s “Eho”(good luck direction), which is now familiar all over Japan. In addition, depending on the region, there is still a custom of visiting shrines and temples twice on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, and this is called "Ninen-mairi". "New Year's Day Visit" and "New Year's Day Visit" were performed, but the custom remained only on New Year's Day, and it became common to ``freely visit famous shrines and temples'' for Eho. did.

In the Heian period, tsuina was held on New Year's Eve in December, and the role of demons called hosouji went around the court with officials who played the role of subordinates to ward off evil. The demon had four golden eyes, wore a vermilion costume, and wielded a shield and a spear. At first, it was a good deity who exorcised evil spirits with its appearance, but around the 9th century, it came to be regarded as an evil spirit and was chased with a bow and arrow. Oni symbolized plague, and people tried to contain the epidemic by warding off demon-shaped plagues with bows and arrows. After that, Setsubun spread to the common people as Setsubun festivals were held at temples and shrines where people used to gather.

February 14th is celebrated as the festival of the goddess Juno. "Goddess Juno" is said to be the goddess who protects women's married life and is said to oversee marriage and childbirth. In ancient times (the Roman Empire), people held a lottery on the day before the Lupercalia festival, which was held the day after this day to pray for fertility and prosperity. We had decided to spend time together. It is said that these customs and the legend of "Saint Valentine" mentioned above were added, and February 14th came to be called "Love Day".

                        <p><span></span>It is said there is an image that Easter is an event that takes place in spring. There is also a reason for this. Easter is said to be derived from the name of the goddess of spring in ancient Germanic mythology, Eoster. This is because the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the image of the goddess symbolizing spring are common, and Easter also includes the meaning of celebrating the arrival of spring. Also, there is a definition that Easter is ``the first Sunday counting from the first full moon after the vernal equinox''. By the way, "Easter Island", which is famous for its moai statues, is said to be associated with being discovered on Easter Day (April 5) in 1722. Also, I think there are many people who have the image of "eggs" and "rabbit" at Easter. There is a proper reason for these, and it is said that the "egg" symbolizes life and is associated with the resurrection of Christ, who was once crucified. On the other hand, "rabbit" is said to be a prolific animal (giving birth to many children) and is a symbol of the prosperity and fertility of offspring.

There is a custom that women weave kimonos and offer them to the shelves to pray for a good harvest and to cleanse the filth. Among them, the women who were selected were called "Tanabata Tatsume", and the name of the loom "Tanabata" that was used for weaving was used for weaving, and the current "Tanabata(棚織)" is called "Tanabata(七夕)". Some say it is called Somen (Japanese thin wheat noodles) is also known as an event food for Tanabata. It is said that somen is likened to the Milky Way, but there is also a twisted Chinese confection called ``Sakuhei'', which is said to be the origin of somen, when the legend of Tanabata was introduced from China. It is said that somen came to be known as an event food for Tanabata as it was passed down together.

First, what is the "Kamioki-no-gi" In the Heian period, it was customary to raise a child with a shaved head until the age of three, and it was believed that keeping the head clean would prevent illness and grow healthy hair. Therefore, this ritual was performed when starting to grow hair from the age of three. The Hakamagi-no-gi ceremony, which is held at the age of 5, was originally a ceremony for both men and women, but changed to a ceremony for boys only during the Edo period. The ritual starts with standing on a go board, which means to take over the world, facing the lucky direction, and wearing a hakama from the left foot, which is said to be auspicious. It is also said that he wore a crown and worshiped the gods of the four directions, with the hope of defeating the enemies on all four sides. And finally, the Obi-de-no-gi, which is held at the age of 7, is a ceremony to celebrate that a child who was wearing a kimono with a string sewn on will wear an obi and wear a kimono like an adult. All of them were held at the milestone of the child's growth, and there was a meaning to wish for the safety of the future.

                        <p><span></span>There is one prevailing theory as to why Christmas is on December 25th. December 25th is associated with the Sun God Mithras' Festival of Lights. The festival of light was held on the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and celebrated the resurrection of the sun. And based on this, the Roman emperor compared Christ to "sun and light" to spread Christianity for political reasons and adopted Mithra's "Festival of Lights" as the birthday of Christ. It is said to have originated from the 25th of the month.

The Christmas tree is also known as the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil". This is believed in Christianity, and there was a tree bearing fruit that God forbade the first human beings "Adam" and "Eve" to eat. They were told that they could eat the fruit of the other trees in the Garden of Eden where they lived, but not the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The reason is that by eating this, humans gain knowledge and power and have the same power as God. However, they were seduced by a snake that was there and ate the fruit of the tree and were banished from the Garden of Eden by God. From such a story, it is said that the red decorations on the current Christmas tree represent the forbidden fruit that Adam and Eve ate.

Shinto has existed in Japan since that time and Amaterasu Omikami is a sun god, and Niniginomikoto is a fertility god and they were believed. Moreover, it’s said that their descendant is a Japanese emperor. The number of Japanese people who know this is low in modern days and depending on our research, the ratio of it was about 20%.

Inevitably, they respected and appreciated to Amaterasu Omikami who is the sun god, Niniginomikoto who is the fertility god, and the emperor who is their descendant.

Therefore, it came to be held the festival for praying the fertility.

The tea that was taken away to Japan by Eisai is a kind of tea called “Hiki cha”, and this is like matcha. At first, the Hiki cha spread in Zen temples and also spread to samurai gradually.

                        <p><span></span>In Japan, the children generally get "otoshidama" from adults in the New Year. The otoshidama is a Japanese custom that the children get some money from their parents and relative in the new year. This is a gift for the children as the bless from Toshigami who is one of all the gods. On Shinto, it's said that he comes to the house for bring happiness of the year.

These were originally the event that is to make Toshigami welcome to the house in the New Year. It is said that he is a grain god, and the people who are in ancient times welcomed him to pray the good harvest ot the year in the New Year.
                            <br><span></span>It was said to the money that is distributed the children by Toshigami who satisfied with hosipitality is Otoshidama. Nowadays, Otoshidama is distributed by parents, relatives and so on, but there is asuch a background.
                            <br><span></span>By the way, the origin of a word that is "toshi" of the Toshigami is a rice plant's grain harvests. The rice plant can crop once a year, so it described 365 days or 366 days as "toshi". (toshi means year)

On the other hand, the good harvest was a gift from god, so they also chanted the appreciation using it. The origin of it is said about 1500 years ago.

This old honorific language has developed to the contemporary it with the times since a social class system was established.

The seyoku is the bath at a temple for the poor, sick and prisoners. In Buddhism, it's very important to take a bath because taking a bath is said to prevent disease and bring happiness. There was even a Buddhist scripture about baths. Taking a bath at that time is not soak in it like these days, but a steam bath.

According to the Nihon Shoki, which is Japan’s oldest written account, it’s said that sumo originated when Nomino Sukune and Taima No Kehaya competed in strength in front of Emperor Suinin. The winner was Nomino Sukune at that time, and he has been enshrined in over 20 shrines as an ancestor of sumo since then.

The main difference between them is the shrine is for the god lives, and there is a torii, and on the other hand, the temple is for the priest lives, and there is a Buddha statue. Many Japanese sometimes visit the shrine for the festival and the first visit of the year to the shrine and also visit the temple for funerals and graves.

Kiyomizu temple is famous for not only sightseeing spot, but also “Kanji of the year”. This is a Kanji that is symbolized this year. Kinkaku-ji is an alias name, and “Rokuon-ji” is the real name. This is a World Cultural Heritage as one of Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto. Toudai-ji has the famous Great Buddha of Nara which is nearly 15 meters. Also, it’s famous for exists many deer around here, but it’s believed the deer is the messenger of God in Shinto, and they have been protected since Kasuga Taisha was built.

The hot-spring hotel called ”Aburaya” which is the set of this movie is a place to refresh all the gods. (In Shinto, it’s believed that a god exists for everything.) In addition, this world that exists the “Aburaya” is a world of the gods, and also an afterlife. Chihiro strays into the world that exists all the gods.

                            <p><span></span>There are some factors of Shinto in Spirited Away. (warning: spoilers)
                                <br><span></span>First, it’s drawn a big tree that lacked the top part, an old torii(an entrance gate of a shrine), and a lot of small shrines of stone at the beginning of the movie. These aren’t managed by anyone obviously. Chihiro said to her mother “What are those?”, her mother said to her “Those are the small shrine of stone which god lives.” This is a scene that these days children and youth don’t know well about religion and god, and adult knows but aren’t interested in it. This means that the belief used to be has been forgotten. As a side note, the top part that lacked of the tree is by the thunderbolt. Thunder is called “kaminari” in Japanese, “kami” means god. It was believed that thunder is a phenomenon that is able to do by only the god in ancient times, so the tree that was hit by thunder is believed sacred tree.                               
                                <br><center><img src="chihiro1.jpg">

                                <br><span></span>Second, Chihiro and her parents pass through a tunnel, and strays into another world. And, her parents have the cuisine of food booth without permission. The foods in that world is for all the god. They whose has had without permission turned into pigs of livestock. On the other hand, Chihiro meet Haku who works at Aburaya, but he said to her surprisingly “Go back to real world!” I guess that the world they stray into is an afterlife. Shinto has a feature that nature worship and ancestor worship. In Shinto, it’s believed that a god exists for nature, and the ancestor is in the world of gods, so I guess that world is both the world of gods and the afterlife. For that reason, there are many humans of translucent(like ghost) and gods in that world.
                                <br><span></span>Third, Chihiro ends up working in Aburaya, and she serves customer called “Kusaregami” Kusaregami is a god who have stink and uncleanness, but Chihiro works seriously. Actually, Kusaregami was a famous god of river, and he suffered from the trash that people dump illegally. Chihiro made him clean by she washes his body seriously, and he said “Well done.”, and go back with satisfaction. In addition, Haku is also a god of river, and he forgot his true name caused his river was filled for land development.
                                <br><span></span>I think Spirited Away shows the view religion of Shinto is forgotten such as the beginning scene, the dirty river by the illegal dump, the filled river by land development, etc., behind Chihiro's growing-up story.

                        <p><span></span>“Princess Mononoke” is one of the Studio Ghibli movie that is made by Hayao Miyazaki in 1997. Above “the Spirited Away” was also made by him. The Princess Mononoke is a story about “Ashitaka”, who is cursed his one arm by “Tatarigami”, take a journey to “the forest of Shishigami” to find the way for break a curse. Tatarigami is like a god have curse and hatred for human who break nature. Shishigami is a god that preside over life and death. In addition, there are a lot of spirits resides in trees, and this movie is based on the nature worship of Shinto. It is written the conflict between humans and nature that happened caused by humans breaking nature by the development of steelmaking technology.

                            <p><span></span>The nature worship of Shinto is to worship mystic power and existence that reside in nature and natural phenomenon. In Shinto, it’s believed spirits and gods reside in trees, rocks, mountains, etc., natural disasters that tsunami, earthquake, etc., is a kind of curse of gods.
                                <br><span></span>Princess Mononoke is so to speak, a story about the conflict between humans and nature. It's developed “Isibiya” (the ancient weapon like a gun) caused by the development of steelmaking technology, and humans use it for killing humans and animals. Ishibiya was a weapon that actually existed in the Muromachi era(1336-1573), so this movie is set in this era. And mankind who try to expand their territory take the mountain from animals by cutting down trees and cultivating a mountain, and the big boar that is a guardian of the mountain is shot by them, and the boar becomes a tatarigami. In addition, they try to kill Shishigami that presides over life and death to get immortality. Shishigami is a motif of deer. In Shinto, the deer is thought messenger of god, so I think shishigami is in the shape of a deer.
                                <br><span></span>Miyazaki Hayao often includes religious view of Shinto to his works. I guess that he aimed to make audience think about how to face nature through the natural worship of Shinto.
